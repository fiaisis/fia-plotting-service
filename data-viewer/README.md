# data-viewer
The data viewer is currently a standalone nextjs project that renders the [h5web](https://github.com/silx-kit/h5web/tree/main/packages/app) component.

This is because scigateway is not compatible with the latest version of react that is required by h5web


## Getting Started

The plotting-service is required to run currently, and is expected on port 8000

With the backend running you can:

- Start a dev server with hot reload with `yarn dev`
- Start an optimised production build with `yarn build`
- Deploy the build output with `yarn start`
- Manually run ESLint with `yarn lint`
